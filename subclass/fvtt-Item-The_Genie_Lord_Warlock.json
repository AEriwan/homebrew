When an enemy causes you to take acid, cold, fire, lighting, or thunder damage, you can choose to transfer some of the damage into the gem instead of suffering it yourself, up to the capacity currently remaining in the gem. It has a maximum capacity for damage equal to twice your warlock level plus your Charisma modifier.\nWhile the gem stores any amount of elemental power, you can use your action to cause it to shed bright light in a 20-foot radius and dim light for an additional 20 feet, to shed dim light in a 5-foot radius, or to douse the light.\nIf you lose your token, you can perform a 1-hour ceremony to receive a replacement from your patron.\n\nThis ceremony can be performed during a short or long rest, and it destroys the previous token.
