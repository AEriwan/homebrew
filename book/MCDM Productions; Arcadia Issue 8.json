The oldest and wisest hags, grandmothers, play this deception so well that they inspire awe in their local communities and aspiring warlocks beg for their patronage. Some sorcerers are born from a hag bloodline and struggle to find acceptance from communities that fear their “grannies.” Bards tell stories of wicked witches in the woods, terrifying children and adults alike.",

The kindly widow with the frightening smile. Hags embody humanity’s fears of manipulation, getting lost, and, worst of all, growing old. Solitary and crafty, hags typically keep only animal familiars as companions. On occasion, however, hags come together in groups of three or more to form covens, greatly increasing their power and spellcasting ability. As rife with disagreement as they are affection, hags in a coven constantly vie for control over each other.",

Hags always twist the odds of these pacts in their favor. Rare is the hag without a grand plan, and rarer still is one that resists the natural temptation to prey upon human nature, bending mortals’ worst impulses for the hag’s amusement. Green hags particularly love to toy with mortal emotions. Night hags are partial to terrifying mortals to death, and sea hags relish destruction in all forms.",

Perhaps a bard is inspired by the Big Bad Wolf, maybe a warlock seeks out Reynard the Fox, or perchance a sorcerer is descended from dreaded Queen Mab. The hag’s legend looms large, but the world of faerie is vast and rife with tales to explore."
