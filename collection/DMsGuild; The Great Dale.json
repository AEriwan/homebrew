This spell's transformative energies cause a fountain of rotting flesh and vegetable matter to erupt in a 20-foot cube centered on that point. Each creature in that area must make a Dexterity saving throw. A creature takes {@damage 3d12} necrotic damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one. Additionally, a creature which fails the saving throw automatically contracts sewer plague (see chapter 8, Diseases, DMG)."

She knew they had adopted her after Alyssa's mother died of a plague when she was very young. Despite her happy upbringing, Alyssa felt she was different from everyone else. The discovery that she could shapeshift came in her early teens when she fell in love with a human girl named Julia.",
					"For a time they were inseparable. They loved exploring their small town together, which was close enough to trade routes that strange travelers would occasionally pass through. One day a drunk visitor followed the two girls as they explored, hoping to rob them. Alyssa somehow knew his intentions and told Julia to run.",
					"Alyssa stood fast as the man demanded her necklace. It was precious to her\u2014it had once belonged to her mother. She was furious that he would demand something that wasn't his. Her mind was a storm of anger and fear; she feared for hers and Julia's safety.",
					"Alyssa's body convulsed. Her physical form transformed into the shape of her father, Lorimar. In this new form, she scratched and kicked at the man who was too drunk to fight back. He stumbled, hitting his head on a rock. He didn't move and Alyssa ran home. As she ran, she realized her body had changed. On arriving home, a mirror in her room shared the truth. She fell asleep cowering in a corner, trying desperately to stay in control.",
					"Later that night she awoke to loud banging. A glance in the mirror revealed her normal appearance. Her father, Vanovar, opened the front door to a visitor, who claimed Lorimar was dead at the hands of bandits. The bandits had attacked Lorimar, claiming he had killed one of their own. Though Lorimar denied he had done this, they refused to listen and killed him.",
					"The visitor said the bandits were known as the \"Thirsty Dogs,\" and that they terrorized travelers on the roads leading to Thay. The visitor said he was from Thay and had lost someone dear to him as well to these thugs. He promised Vanovar and Alyssa that he would hunt the bandits down and make them pay for what they had done.",
					"Alyssa believes it was her fault that her father died and has never forgiven herself. It is a secret she keeps to this day.",
