Each lodge has its own personality, expressed by their fighting styles and appearance. Lodge are protected by their own telthor, usually of a creature related to the lodge's name. The members of each lodge are grouped into \"Fangs,\" elite fighting forces ready to answer the Iron Lord's call to defend the nation. Initiation rites vary by lodge but invariably require a demonstration of fighting prowess and completion of various tests such as all-night drinking contests or single handed battle against every member of the lodge. Have you joined one of the large, well-known lodges or are you a member of a small lodge few have heard of? Whatever the case, most Rashemaar look to you with respect and admiration.",
