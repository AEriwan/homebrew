The pool must be large enough to fully submerge the subject, and should be constructed with ideal measurements to the specifications of both humanoid and draconic shapes. A lid or grille can be employed, to prevent the subject from bursting to the surface prematurely. Avoid using shackles to ground the subject, as they will interfere with metamorphosis.",
                                "The submerged subject will be unable to breathe, and may flail during the procedure. Transmutation or enchantment magics can relieve the need to breathe or keep the subject calm, but are not necessary to complete the procedure.",
                                "Before immersion, the subject should be supplied with a dragon's heart, or one should be placed within the pool where the subject can reach it. As soon as the subject is fully submerged, establish an arcane feedback loop by channeling as much magical power through the dragon's heart and into the subject as possible. The type of magic employed is irrelevant, only the magnitude matters.",
                                "If the subject establishes a viable connection with the magical energies channeled through the heart, the subject will proceed with metamorphosis. If not, the subject will expire, and all spent materials will be wasted.",
                                "At the height of the procedure, when the subject begins to show signs of metamorphosis, the subject must consume the imbued heart while remaining submerged. An unwilling or unaware subject will expire, so make certain that the subject is adequately informed. A particularly rebellious subject may choose to refuse in spite of their demise. In such a case, enchantment magics must be employed to force the subject.",
                                "Once the heart is consumed, the application of channeled magic can cease. At this point, the subject will be deep in the throes of metamorphosis and will lose consciousness, at which point no further action is required. However, it can be useful to supply the subject with wing bones by way of telekinesis, in order to encourage the growth of new limbs. These bones must be in undamaged condition, but need not consist of a full set of an entirely accurate size fit, as the subject will compensate for a lack of accuracy in their own time. The development of wings seems to be more difficult than that of the tail, and therefore little encouragement is needed in that regard.",
                                "Depending upon the type of dragon that the heart belonged to, additional measures can be taken to cement the subject as matching that type. This includes ensuring that both the blood and heart used belongs to the same type of dragon, and making additions to the ritual based on the habits and personality of the dragon in question—such as mixing in brackish water corrupted by a black dragon—or casting spells matching the characteristics of the dragon type during the ritual, such as {@spell stone shape} for a copper dragon. A failure to appropriately address the subject in this manner will manifest as cosmetic inconsistencies, such as unusual scale colors and physical features matching no known true dragon. As this is ultimately not harmful to the health of the subject, adhering to a specific dragon type can be encouraged or forfeited as desired.",
                                "The subject will gradually absorb a portion of the dragon's blood. Allow the subject to lie or float freely during this time. In most cases, the subject will be left {@condition unconscious} for several hours. Don't disturb the subject, but ensure that they can breathe freely at this stage.",
                                "Most subjects will be left scaleless, and with clearly underdeveloped limbs. This is normal, and will correct itself over time. Some subjects have been observed to form 'dewdrops of blood', which resolve into fully-formed scales within a matter of hours. These subjects tend to be healthier and more active following the procedure. While a fascinating occurrence, it is unclear what causes the phenomenon.",
                                "Allow the subject to sleep. Any blood remaining in the pool is tainted and useless, and should be disposed of. In the following days, the subject will experience a craving for magical energy and an inexplicable ability to extract it from any valid source. While it can be useful to make use of this craving to establish your relationship as a superior with the subject, it is recommended to indulge it at first, as it seems to have a positive effect on the subject's condition. Make certain that a meal both physical and magical is left ready for when the subject regains consciousness.",
                                "Some subjects of unusual species have been observed to retain features of their former countenance. One avian subject maintained beak features, while another did not. Tests have proven inconclusive, and the matter is discarded as irrelevant."
